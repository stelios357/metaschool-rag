## 👋 Welcome

This repository provides a *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)* pipeline for recommending Metaschool courses based on a user’s query. It uses [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) to index course content and return the *top course recommendations* when users ask what they’d like to learn next.

We discuss all sorts of topics in our Discord, and we’d love for you to learn and participate there. **[Join our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/metaschool)** to keep building with us.

## 🔮 Learning Projects

You can start with the following Metaschool courses right away (just examples):
- *Write your first Hello World contract*  
- *Mint an Elon Musk NFT*  
- *Create a Horoscope Web3 NFT Application*  
- *Launch your epic NFT marketplace*

This RAG system helps you find the right course for your needs by searching through all available course content, so you don’t have to guess which one to pick.

We’re making these projects open-source because we know we can’t build world-class learning experiences without your support. If you see an error or have an improvement, please submit a pull request.

## 📖 How to Use

1. *Install Dependencies*  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure you have a supported Python version and a valid OPENAI_API_KEY (if you’re using OpenAI embeddings).
	2.	Set Up the Folder Structure
	•	Create a folder called Learning_Projects at the same level as the main Python script.
	•	Each course should be a subfolder, with nested .md files.
	3.	Run the System

python rag_system.py

Type your query when prompted (e.g., I want to learn Solidity) and watch the magic happen!
